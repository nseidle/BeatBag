 BeatBag - A Speed Bag Counter

 License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).

 BeatBag is a speed bag counter that uses an accelerometer to counts the number hits. 
 It's easily installed ontop of speed bag platform only needing an accelerometer attached to the top of platform. 
 You don't have to alter the hitting surface or change out the swivel.

 I combine X/Y/Z into one vector and look only at the magnitude. 
 I use a fourth order filter to see the impacts (accelerometer peaks) from the speed bag. It works pretty well.
 It's very reproducible but I'm not entirely sure how accurate it is. I can detect both bag hits (forward/backward) then
 I divide by two to get the number displayed to the user.

 I arrived at the peak detection algorithm using video and raw data recordings. After a fourth filtering I could glean the
 peaks. There is probably a much better way to do the math on the peak detection but it's not one of my strength.

 Hardware setup:
 5V from wall supply goes into barrel jack on Redboard. Trace cut to diode.
 RedBoard barel jack is wired to power switch then to Vin diode
 Display gets power from Vin and data from I2C pins
 Vcc/Gnd from RedBoard goes into Bread Board Power supply that supplies 3.3V to accelerometer. Future
 versions should get power from 3.3V rail on RedBoard. 

 MMA8452 Breakout ------------ Arduino
 3.3V --------------------- 3.3V
 SDA(yellow) -------^^(330)^^------- A4
 SCL(blue) -------^^(330)^^------- A5
 GND ---------------------- GND
 The MMA8452 is 3.3V so we recommend using 330 or 1k resistors between a 5V Arduino and the MMA8452 breakout.
 The MMA8452 has built in pull-up resistors for I2C so you do not need additional pull-ups.

 3/2/2013 - Got data from Hugo and myself, 3 rounds, on 2g setting. Very noisy but mostly worked

 12/19/15 - Segment burned out. Power down display after 10 minutes of non-use.
 Use I2C, see if we can avoid the 'multiply by 10' display problem.

 1/23/16 - Accel not reliable. Because the display is now also on the I2C but the pull-up resistors on the accel where
 not enough. Swapped out to new accel. Added 100ohm inline resistors to accel and 4.7k resistors from SDA/SCL to 5V.
 Reinforced connection from accel to RedBoard.
